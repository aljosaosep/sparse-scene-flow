# Combined Image- and World-Space Tracking in Traffic Scenes

This repository contains code for the tracking system as described in
**Combined Image- and World-Space Tracking in Traffic Scenes. ICRA 2017. (https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/paper_final_compressed.pdf)**

By Aljosa Osep, Wolfgang Mehner, Markus Mathias, Bastian Leibe at Computer Vision Group, RWTH Aachen University

## Demo  Video
TODO

## Prerequisite

In order to run the code, your setup has to meet the following minimum requirements (tested versions in parentheses. Other versions might work, too):

* GCC 4.8.4
  * Eigen (3.x)
  * Boost (1.55 or later)
  * OpenCV (3.2.0 + OpenCV contrib)
  * PCL (1.8.x)

## Install

### Compiling the code using CMake
0.  `mkdir build`
0.  `cmake ..`
0.  `make all`

### Running the tracker
0.  Edit the config `%PROJ_DIR%/data/kitti_sample.cfg`, set all the paths.
0.  Run the tracker eg. `CIWTApp --config %PROJ_DIR%/data/kitti_sample.cfg --start_frame 0 --end_frame 15 --show_visualization_2d --show_visualization_3d`
0.  Find a small sample of KITTI tracking dataset in `%PROJ_DIR%/data/kitti_sample` (left/right camera images, Regionlets detections, calibration files).

## Remarks

* Tracking modes
    * There are two tracking modes, `detection` and `detection_shape` (set via `--tracking_mode`, or set in the config)
    * They perform similarly when evaluating MOTA in image-domain (KITTI eval. protocol), `detection_shape` provides significantly more precise localization in the 3D space while the `detection` mode is faster.

* Data preprocessing
    * The tracker requires disparity maps to run, `detection_shape` additionally requires 3D segments (eg. generic object proposals, shipped with the tracker).
    * When you run the tracker for the first time, both will be computed on-the-fly, which will significantly slow-down the proc. time.

* External libraries
    * The tracker ships the following external modules:
        * **libelas** - disparity estimation (http://www.cvlibs.net/software/libelas/)
        * **libviso2** - egomotion estimation (http://www.cvlibs.net/software/libviso/)

* Etc
    * The tracking framework does not ship a scene-flow estimator (you can get one here https://github.com/vogechri/PRSM)
    * In the paper experiments, we additionally used a scene-flow estimator to obtain velocity estimates of the 3D segments. You can input to the tracker velocity maps via `--flow_map_path`, but it is not necessary. Tracker will work just fine without it.


* Run the tracker in `release` mode (oterwise it will be slow).
